# Demo Universal Router with React

> Declare routes & one single `resolve()`method that `ReactDOM.render()` the page.

> Layout Suspense/lazy easy with `next()` middleware and

> Async routes. Can `fetch()` data before rendering the page to be rendered.

> Needs external state manager (eg Mobx) to pass the props

> Bug with redirection with `next()`. Don't use `next()` with `{redirect: "/"}`, but recode the page to be rendered.
